## 1. Introduction to Unsupervised Learning üîç

### What is Unsupervised Learning?

**Unsupervised learning** is a type of machine learning where algorithms find hidden patterns in data **without labeled examples**. Unlike supervised learning (where we have input-output pairs), unsupervised learning works with input data only.

### Key Characteristics:
- **No target variable**: We don't know the "correct" answer
- **Pattern discovery**: Algorithms find structure in data automatically
- **Exploratory nature**: Often used to understand data better
- **Subjective evaluation**: Results require human interpretation

### Types of Unsupervised Learning:

#### 1. **Clustering**
- Groups similar data points together
- Examples: Customer segmentation, gene sequencing, image classification

#### 2. **Association Rules**
- Finds relationships between different variables
- Examples: Market basket analysis ("People who buy X also buy Y")

#### 3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
- Reduces the number of features while preserving information
- Examples: Data visualization, feature selection, noise reduction

## 2. Clustering Algorithms üéØ

### What is Clustering?

**Clustering** is the process of grouping data points so that:
- Points in the same group (cluster) are **similar** to each other
- Points in different groups are **dissimilar** to each other

### K-Means Clustering

#### How it Works:
1. **Choose K**: Decide how many clusters you want
2. **Initialize**: Place K centroids randomly
3. **Assign**: Each point goes to the nearest centroid
4. **Update**: Move centroids to the center of their assigned points
5. **Repeat**: Steps 3-4 until centroids stop moving

#### Advantages:
- Simple and fast
- Works well with spherical clusters
- Scales well to large datasets

#### Disadvantages:
- Must choose K beforehand
- Sensitive to initialization
- Assumes clusters are spherical and similar sizes

#### Choosing the Right K:
- **Elbow Method**: Plot inertia vs K, look for the "elbow"
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Measures how well-separated clusters are
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business understanding of expected segments

### Other Clustering Algorithms:

#### **DBSCAN (Density-Based)**
- Finds clusters based on density
- Can find arbitrary shapes
- Automatically determines number of clusters
- Good for outlier detection

#### **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Creates a tree of clusters
- Can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down)
- Provides multiple levels of granularity
- Useful for understanding data structure

#### **Gaussian Mixture Models**
- Assumes data comes from multiple Gaussian distributions
- Provides probabilistic cluster assignments
- Can handle overlapping clusters

## 3. Anomaly Detection üö®

### What is Anomaly Detection?

**Anomaly detection** identifies data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. These points are called:
- **Anomalies** or **Outliers**
- **Novelties** (in new data)
- **Exceptions** or **Deviations**

### Types of Anomalies:

#### 1. **Point Anomalies**
- Individual data points that are unusual
- Example: A customer spending $50,000 when typical spending is $500

#### 2. **Contextual Anomalies**
- Normal in one context, abnormal in another
- Example: Heavy coat sales in summer

#### 3. **Collective Anomalies**
- Individual points are normal, but the collection is unusual
- Example: Many small transactions from the same account in a short time

### Anomaly Detection Methods:

#### **1. Isolation Forest**
**Principle**: Anomalies are easier to isolate than normal points

**How it works**:
- Randomly select a feature and split value
- Recursively partition data
- Anomalies require fewer splits to isolate
- Shorter paths indicate anomalies

**Advantages**:
- No assumptions about data distribution
- Linear time complexity
- Works well with high-dimensional data

**Use cases**: Fraud detection, network security, quality control

#### **2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
**Principle**: Anomalies have different local density than their neighbors

**How it works**:
- Calculate local density for each point
- Compare with neighbors' densities
- Points with much lower density are anomalies

**Advantages**:
- Detects local anomalies
- Works with varying densities
- Provides anomaly scores

**Use cases**: Intrusion detection, sensor data analysis

#### **3. One-Class SVM**
**Principle**: Learn the boundary of normal data

**How it works**:
- Train on normal data only
- Creates a boundary around normal points
- New points outside boundary are anomalies

**Advantages**:
- Works with high-dimensional data
- Robust to outliers in training data

#### **4. Statistical Methods**
**Principle**: Anomalies are statistically improbable

**Examples**:
- **Z-score**: Points more than 3 standard deviations from mean
- **IQR method**: Points outside 1.5 √ó IQR from quartiles
- **Gaussian distribution**: Points in low-probability regions

## 4. Evaluation Metrics üìä

### Clustering Evaluation:

#### **Internal Metrics** (no ground truth needed):
- **Inertia**: Sum of squared distances to centroids (lower is better)
- **Silhouette Score**: How well-separated clusters are (-1 to 1, higher is better)
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance

#### **External Metrics** (when ground truth available):
- **Adjusted Rand Index**: Similarity to true clustering
- **Normalized Mutual Information**: Information shared with true labels
- **Homogeneity & Completeness**: Purity measures

### Anomaly Detection Evaluation:

#### **When Ground Truth Available**:
- **Precision**: True anomalies / Detected anomalies
- **Recall**: True anomalies / All actual anomalies
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under ROC curve

#### **When No Ground Truth**:
- **Visual inspection**: Plot anomalies and verify manually
- **Domain expertise**: Subject matter expert validation
- **Consistency**: Multiple methods agreeing on anomalies

## 5. Data Preprocessing for Unsupervised Learning üîß

### Feature Scaling
**Why needed**: Different scales can dominate distance calculations

**Methods**:
- **StandardScaler**: Mean = 0, Std = 1
- **MinMaxScaler**: Scale to [0,1] range
- **RobustScaler**: Uses median and IQR (robust to outliers)

### Dimensionality Reduction
**Why needed**: Curse of dimensionality affects distance-based algorithms

**Methods**:
- **PCA**: Linear transformation preserving variance
- **t-SNE**: Non-linear, good for visualization
- **UMAP**: Preserves local and global structure

### Handling Missing Values
- **Remove**: If few missing values
- **Impute**: Mean, median, or mode
- **Advanced**: KNN imputation, iterative imputation

## 7. Best Practices and Tips üí°

### Clustering Best Practices:
1. **Understand your data**: Explore before clustering
2. **Scale features**: Use appropriate scaling methods
3. **Choose K carefully**: Use multiple methods to determine optimal clusters
4. **Interpret results**: Business meaning is crucial
5. **Validate clusters**: Check if they make business sense

### Anomaly Detection Best Practices:
1. **Define normal**: Understand what constitutes normal behavior
2. **Choose appropriate method**: Based on data characteristics
3. **Set thresholds carefully**: Balance false positives vs false negatives
4. **Monitor performance**: Anomaly patterns may change over time
5. **Combine methods**: Multiple algorithms can improve detection

### Common Pitfalls:
- **Assuming clusters exist**: Not all data naturally clusters
- **Ignoring domain knowledge**: Technical results need business interpretation
- **Over-fitting**: Too many clusters or too sensitive anomaly detection
